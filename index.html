                     An implementation of lots of grass objects placed on some terrain waving in the wind. Grass-meshes are placed in the world
                     through GPU-instancing to be able to support thousands of instances, with a vertex shader facilitating the movement of each grass mesh. 
                     The calculations for the positions, scales and rotations of each grass mesh are done through a compute shader to speed up scene initialization.

                    Master thesis conducted at KTH regarding the analysis of human perception of procedural 3D terrains with the use of perceptual texture features.
                    The thesis aimed to investigate whether different methods for procedurally generate terrains produced results discernable to humans,
                    what featues corresponded most to certain algorithms and to understand perceptual relationships between different methods for
                    procedurally generate terrains.

                    A game written in Unity where you control a boat going down an infinite river, trying to avoid bumping into obstacles and the river bank.
                    The player can control the speed of the boat via microphone input, and the direction the boat is travelling in via their webcam through
                    hand recognition. If the player move their hands to the right side of the webcam, the boat would turn right and so on.
                    The hand recognition was done through a python script utilizing google media pipe. The computer vision prediction for the users' hand positions was then sent to unity through a UDP web-socket.
                    The game features fully infinite procedurally generated terrain, procedurally placed obstacles in the river and decorations on the terrain, volumetric clouds and geometric grass done through a geometry shader.

                    An asynchronous coop-game written in unity where one person in VR has to escape a maze, and is being assisted by another player on keyboard and mouse.
                    The VR-player gets placed in a procedurally generated maze, and needs to find their way to safety while dodging monster lurking inside the maze.
                    VR-locomotion is achieved by mimicking the arm movements one does when jogging/running. The player using keyboard and mouse on the other hand has a top down view of the maze, 
                    meaning they can see where the exit is, where the monster is and so on, and can therefore communicate with the VR player to keep them safe and on track. 
                    The keyboard and mouse player can also directly influence the state of the maze in a multitude of ways.

                    Work done for an ongoing research project at KTH, where I was employed as a research assistant by KTH to perform this work. My task 
                    was to create a program that could visualize a recorded route an unmanned vehicle had taken. This route was made up of latitudes and longitudes,
                    along with other necessary data, and could be read into the program either directly via file, a UDP web-socket or transmitted from an MQTT-server. 
                    The program was implemented in Unity, has VR capabilities/compatability, and containes terrain created from real life height data.

                    Project where I created and rendered some procedural mountains from scratch. Written in c++, the project utilized SDL to draw pixels to the screen, 
                    and both a ray-tracer and a rasterizer was implemented to render the resulting geometry. The procedural mountains were generated with the help of simplex noise, 
                    fractional Brownian motion, and Hydraulic erosion. The geometry was then shaded with phong shading.
